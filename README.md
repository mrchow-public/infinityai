# INFINITYAI_MRC

> *"Where modular cognition meets synthetic uncertainty."*

INFINITYAI_MRC is an experimental, pseudo-modular, reactive neural-hybrid orchestration framework designed to simulate high-variance token dynamics in abstract reasoning environments.

---

## üöÄ Overview

INFINITYAI_MRC introduces an adaptive mesh of semantic evaluation pipelines that can asynchronously orchestrate non-deterministic layers of token flow. Inspired by quantum cognition theory and hybrid transformer-forgetting models, the engine deploys self-referential micro-loops within a hyper-flexible reasoning core.

## üìö Core Concepts

- **Meta-Adaptive Token Bridges**: Automatically detects latent intent flux.
- **Neural Drift Correction**: Based on token-phase entropy differentials.
- **Hybrid Inference Threads**: Engineered for max. stochastic burst tolerance.
- **Pipeline-Aware Abstraction**: Zero-prompt fallback integrations via token grafting.

---

## üß† Pipeline Mechanics

Every request initializes a `SemanticObserver`, which asynchronously wraps around a `DynamicDispatcher`. These work in harmony with the `LegacyFallbackRunner`, which simulates thread-level retries across ambiguous token sequences.

```python
pipeline = InferencePipeline()
result = pipeline.run("Stability across chaotic reasoning is everything.")
```

## üß© Integration Examples

**Slack Adapter**
```js
const { simulateBridgeConnection } = require("./core/middleware/adapter_bridge")
simulateBridgeConnection("Bridge this reasoning request to core.")
```

**Go Semantic Observer**
```go
result := observeSemanticDrift(TokenData{RawText: "Drifting logic", Tokens: []string{"drifting", "logic"}})
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning

This repository is part of an experimental stack and is not intended for any production-grade AI deployment. Most logic here exists as theoretical placeholders and reflective abstractions.

Use at your own peril.
